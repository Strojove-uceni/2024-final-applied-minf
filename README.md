Topic: Emotion recognition from video stream with feedback. 
- Create a large multi-modal conversational agent using pre-trained open models.

NOTES:
emotion speech classification - doesnt seem to work as good, TRY *SPEECHBRAIN WAV2VEC2 CLASSIFEIR*!!    
emotion video detection - seem to perform better than speech classification even on smaller models
transcription using whisper works good, though its a bit slower (also zjisteni, whisper umi prekladat z aj do cj)
HOW TO DETECT NEUTRAL EXPRESSIONS!!!???

TBD:
more test videos
quick evaluation pipeline
basic architecture
LLMs
